I")<p>In this chapter we‚Äôll look at the process of creating meter and tempo events as well as linear tempo changes. We‚Äôll discuss using pre and post roll for recording. We‚Äôll also cover loop recording both audio and MIDI and how they differ.</p>

<h2 id="adding-meter-and-tempo-events">Adding Meter and Tempo Events</h2>
<p>The rulers in the Edit window display items like meter changes, tempo changes, markers, etc. as events represented by icons. The rulers aren‚Äôt accessible at the time of this writing. However, it should be noted that all operations performed through the various time and tempo operations windows simply apply the parameters defined within the windows and overwrite any previous data with any newly entered parameters.</p>

<h3 id="adding-meter-changes">Adding Meter Changes</h3>
<p>To add meter changes, navigate to the location where you‚Äôd like the meter to change and choose EVENT &gt; TIME OPERATIONS &gt; CHANGE METER‚Ä¶ and, in the resulting dialog, enter the desired meter and press the  Apply button.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-linear-tempo-change">Creating a Linear Tempo Change</h3>
<p>To create a linear tempo change, make sure the Conductor is enabled in the MIDI Control Cluster, select the range over which you‚Äôd like the tempo to change and choose EVENT &gt; TEMPO OPERATIONS &gt; LINEAR‚Ä¶ and, in the resulting dialog, enter the desired tempo values and press the Apply button.</p>

<h2 id="recording-selections">Recording Selections</h2>
<p>When overdubbing or creating punch-ins, it‚Äôs often useful to create a selection which defines the range through which recording will take place. By using functions like pre/post roll and loop recording, one can precisely drop in and out of record mode automatically and, if necessary, use the defined range for loop recording to capture several performances of the selected section.</p>

<h3 id="creating-and-adjusting-a-selection">Creating and Adjusting a Selection</h3>
<p>A selection can be defined in several ways that we‚Äôve covered earlier. Let‚Äôs review some methods for making a selection and take a look at how to adjust the selection.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="using-pre--and-post-roll">Using Pre- and Post-Roll</h2>
<p>To enable Pre/Post Roll in a session, choose OPTIONS &gt; PRE/POST ROLL or press Command+K. This will enable both pre and post roll at the same time. In the Transport cluster of the Edit window or in the Transport window itself, you can independently enable pre and post roll. Whenever the pre or post roll value is edited (either from the Transport display or with Flo Tools), the respective mode is activated automatically.</p>

<h2 id="loop-recording-differences-audio-versus-midi">Loop Recording Differences: Audio Versus MIDI</h2>
<p>While the process of loop recording audio and MIDI are essentially the same, there are a couple of differences. With audio, new clips are created with each pass and only the latest pass remains in the main playlist. With MIDI, it‚Äôs much the same but with the added option to merge the MIDI data, thus superimposing MIDI notes over others, creating a composite performance.</p>

<h3 id="loop-recording-and-playlists">Loop Recording and Playlists</h3>
<p>Pro Tools offers two ways to access the clips that are created during the loop recording process. One method is a little more comprehensive but is somewhat trickier to execute and the other is very straight-forward but more limited. Let‚Äôs take a look at the simpler method first which involves the automatic creation of new playlists. In the Operations tab of the Pro Tools Preferences window, under the Recording area, check the box for ‚ÄúAutomatically Create New Playlists When Loop Recording.‚Äù With this preference enabled, each recorded pass of the looped section will be placed on a new playlist automatically. Going through the takes is as simple as cycling playlists.</p>

<h3 id="recording-midi-using-loop-playback-with-midi-merge">Recording MIDI Using Loop Playback with MIDI Merge</h3>
<p>when loop recording with MIDI, the process illustrated above is similar. However, MIDI loop recording offers another possibility for continuously overdubbing nondestructively the way a traditional hardware pattern sequencer does. To use MIDI Merge for loop recording, select the MIDI Merge button within the MIDI Controls cluster of the Edit window or Transport window or press 9 on the numeric keypad to toggle MIDI Merge on and off. If you‚Äôre using Flo Tools, pressing num pad 9 reports the status of the MIDI Merge button and double-tapping will toggle the control. For Pro Tools | Ultimate users, the Flo Tools command is Option+9 on the numeric keypad.</p>
