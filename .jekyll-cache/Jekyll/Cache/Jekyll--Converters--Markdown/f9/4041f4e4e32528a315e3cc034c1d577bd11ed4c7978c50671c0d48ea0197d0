<h2 id="editing-using-keyboard-shortcuts">Editing Using Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Although the editing tools that sighted users rely on are not accessible to screen readers, there is a plethora of keyboard shortcuts available for practically every editing task. The Pro Tools Shortcuts PDF lists all of them and organizes them into categories. 
for editing.</p>

<h3 id="shortcuts-for-auditioning">Shortcuts for Auditioning</h3>
<p>Use the auditioning shortcuts to hear what precedes or follows your selected range or insertion cursor.</p>

  <li>Play by Post-roll value From Selection start/End (or Current Cursor Location if No Selection),: Command+left/right arrows</li>
  <li>Play by Pre and Post-Roll Value Through Selection Start/End,: Command+Option+left/right arrows</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="edit-selection-definition-and-navigation-shortcuts">Edit Selection, Definition and Navigation Shortcuts</h3>
<p>We‚Äôve briefly covered some keyboard shortcuts for navigating through clip boundaries. Let‚Äôs look at all of the shortcuts available for navigation and selection.</p>

<audio controls=""><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PTAccess/PTAccess.github.io/master/audio/168 Navigation and Selection Shortcuts.mp3" /></audio>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="setting-the-song-start">Setting the Song Start</h3>

<p>Every session includes a song start marker that appears, by default at the beginning of the timeline. You can set the song start to any position on the timeline. It‚Äôs sometimes useful to set a song start position to a location other than the beginning of the timeline, especially if you have pick-up bars or empty pre-roll space before the actual start of the session content. The song start is also handy when you‚Äôd like to make a selection from the end of the timeline to the song start rather than the beginning of the timeline. Under the Event menu, choose Time Operations &gt; Move Song Start‚Ä¶ to change the position of the song start marker. You can move to the song start by pressing Control+Return and you can select to the song start from anywhere on the timeline by pressing Shift+Control+Return.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-playlists">Working With Playlists</h2>
<p>Playlists in Pro Tools offer a means to access multiple takes within a track without the need to use up multiple tracks. Whichever playlist is the topmost (or frontmost) is considered the main playlist. A track inherits its name from the main playlist. One of the most powerful features of Pro Tools is its capabilities for fast creation and editing a composite of several playlists (known as ‚Äúcomping‚Äù).</p>

<h3 id="creating-and-duplicating-playlists">Creating and Duplicating Playlists</h3>
<p>As soon as a track is created, it has an empty playlist. Once clips have been recorded or pasted on the track, the playlist can be duplicated to facilitate experimentation with arrangement for example. Alternatively, a new blank playlist can be created, preserving the contents of the previous playlist. Several playlists can be created with the option of making any one of the playlists the current (or main) playlist. The playlist selector can be found within the track strips of the Edit window.</p>

<h3 id="playlist-creation-duplication-and-navigation-shortcuts">Playlist Creation, Duplication and Navigation Shortcuts</h3>
<p>Pro Tools offers a number of shortcuts for creating and duplicating playlists that apply either globally to all or only to selected tracks.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="track-compositing-or-comping-a-track">Track Compositing or Comping a Track</h3>
<p>By selecting portions of various playlists and copying or moving them to a designated ‚Äútarget‚Äù playlist, one can create what‚Äôs known as a ‚Äúcomposite track.‚Äù This process is often referred to as ‚Äúcomping.‚Äù Pro Tools offers a number of keyboard shortcuts to speed up the process of comping. Before getting into the comping process, one must define one of the existing playlists as a target for the assembly of clips.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-a-target-playlist">Setting Up a Target Playlist</h3>
<p>To set up a target playlist, select a track and use its playlist selector to select a playlist from the Target submenu or press Command+Shift+Right Arrow. The chosen playlist will become the target to which  clips will either be moved or copied.</p>

<audio controls=""><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PTAccess/PTAccess.github.io/master/audio/173 Setting Up a Target Playlist.mp3" /></audio>

<h3 id="track-compositing-shortcuts">Track Compositing Shortcuts</h3>
<p>Once you‚Äôve defined a target playlist, you can use keyboard shortcuts to quickly copy or move edit selections to the target playlist as well as navigate quickly between target and other playlists.</p>

<audio controls=""><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PTAccess/PTAccess.github.io/master/audio/174 Track Compositing Shortcuts.mp3" /></audio>

  <li>Cycle in Audio from Previous Playlist, Command+Shift+Up Arrow</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="working-with-fades">Working with Fades</h2>
<p>As we saw earlier, fades can quickly be added from the insertion cursor to the start or end of a clip or across adjacent clip boundaries using default curve shapes. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the Fade dialog, the available options within the various types of fade dialogs and how to manage settings and presets.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-fades-dialog-boxes">Using the Fades Dialog Boxes</h3>
<p>The various types of fade dialog boxes have different options related to the respective fade type. Let‚Äôs take a look at some of the available options.</p>

<audio controls=""><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PTAccess/PTAccess.github.io/master/audio/175 Using the Fades Dialog Boxes.mp3" /></audio>

<h3 id="using-fade-presets">Using Fade Presets</h3>
<p>Each Fade dialog has a set of 5 presets. A set of presets can be saved as a settings file. You can load a settings file or manage settings from the Librarian menu. Command-click any preset to store the current settings in that preset slot. Press Control+1-5 to recall Presets 1-5.</p>

<h3 id="editing-existing-fades">Editing Existing Fades</h3>
<p>Pro Tools sees fades as being associated with clips but also sees them as having boundaries. We‚Äôve seen how tabbing to fade boundaries works. When selecting an entire fade, it‚Äôs possible to edit the fade‚Äôs position and length using some of the same keyboard shortcuts used for editing clips.</p>

<audio controls=""><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PTAccess/PTAccess.github.io/master/audio/177 Editing Existing Fades.mp3" /></audio>

<h3 id="deleting-fades">Deleting Fades</h3>
<p>By selecting a clip and pressing the Backspace key, a fade can be deleted and the underlying audio remains. To delete multiple fades, select a range and choose EDIT &gt; FADES &gt; Delete.</p>
