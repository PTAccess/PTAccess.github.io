I"Ñ<p>This chapter focuses on the Elastic Audio feature of Pro Tools. At the time of this publication, Elastic Audio is only somewhat accessible. Normally, one would rely heavily on what are known as event markers and warp markers to define and manipulate ranges of audio for stretching and compressing in order to alter timing. Since these markers are not yet accessible, the options available are limited but we will cover a few areas that are in part useable.</p>
